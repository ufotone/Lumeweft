/**
 * Content signature for per-clip render bakes.
 *
 * A full bake (cacheKind 'full') is valid only while the clip's
 * bake-relevant content matches what was rendered. Rather than patching
 * every store mutation to invalidate caches (and hoping future mutations
 * remember to), consumers compare the signature captured at render time
 * against the clip's current signature. Store mutations always produce new
 * clip objects (zustand immutability), so a WeakMap memo makes the check
 * O(1) per clip version — cheap enough for per-frame render paths.
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED from the signature: startTime/trackId (moving a
 * clip doesn't change its baked pixels), opacity/blendMode (kept live by
 * the bake contract), and transitions (composited live over the bake).
