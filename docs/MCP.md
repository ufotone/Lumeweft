# Velorn MCP Guide

Velorn includes a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so AI agents can inspect and operate on the open Velorn project. It is designed for agents such as Codex, Claude Code, Cursor-compatible MCP clients, and other open source MCP clients that can talk to a local HTTP MCP server.

The MCP server is part of the desktop app. It exposes the current project, active timeline, assets, ComfyUI connection state, generation state, visual frame inspection, safe timeline edit actions, caption actions, export actions, and workflow setup helpers.

## Quick Start

1. Launch the Velorn desktop app.
2. Open a project. Some setup tools work without a project, but timeline and asset tools need one.
3. Open `Settings > Agents (MCP)`.
4. Confirm the server is `Running`.
5. Connect your MCP client to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp
```

The in-app settings panel also shows copyable setup commands.

For Codex:

```bash
codex mcp add velorn --url http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp
```

For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http velorn http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp
```

For clients that use an `.mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "velorn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Velorn keeps this same local config in the repository root for development.

## What Agents Can Do

Velorn MCP is useful for five broad workflows:

- Review an edit: inspect timelines, clips, visible shots, frame contact sheets, disabled clips, missing media, gaps, markers, transforms, and export readiness.
- Make safe editorial changes: move, trim, split, delete, enable/disable, label, retime, adjust audio, add transitions, manage tracks, and manage timelines.
- Build graphics and polish: add text, shapes, solids, adjustment clips, GLSL effects, keyframes, motion blur, dips to black, and clip styling.
- Drive generation: prepare Generate from the current timeline frame, queue approved generation batches, inspect bundled workflows, validate ComfyUI nodes, and place generated assets back into timelines.
- Deliver: set In/Out ranges, run H.264 delivery exports, run social delivery batches, export FCPXML, and inspect exported files.

The MCP server is not a replacement for the Velorn UI. It is a project-aware control layer for agents. The best results come from asking the agent to inspect first, show a preview plan, then apply only after approval.

## Safety Model

The server runs only on loopback:

```text
127.0.0.1:19790
```

Do not proxy or expose this port to a network. Any local process that can connect to the port can call the MCP server while Velorn is running.

Most write-capable tools support `previewOnly` and many default to preview mode. In preview mode the tool returns the planned operation and usually a suggested apply call. To apply, the agent calls the same tool again with:

```json
{ "previewOnly": false }
```

Recommended agent behavior:

1. Use read tools first.
2. Use `find_timeline_items` before targeting clips, markers, tracks, transitions, or assets from natural language.
3. Use `previewOnly: true` before write actions.
4. Ask for explicit user approval before applying changes that write files, queue generation, spend credits, start GPU work, change settings, or modify timelines.
5. Use `create_project_checkpoint` before risky multi-step edits.
6. Use `run_mcp_action_plan` for approved multi-step work so Velorn can checkpoint first and stop on the first error.

Undoable timeline changes use Velorn's normal undo stack. Project creation, project duplication, exports, generated assets, and imported media can write files to disk.

## A Good First Agent Prompt

After connecting your client, try:

```text
You are connected to Velorn. Call get_mcp_recipes, summarize what review and edit passes are available, then inspect the open project with get_project and get_timeline. Do not make changes yet.
```

For a timeline health pass:

```text
Review this Velorn timeline for delivery risks. Use analyze_timeline and check_media_health first. If you want to add markers, show me the add_timeline_markers previewOnly plan before applying anything.
```

For visual review:

```text
Inspect the next 20 visible shots from the playhead. Tell me what each shot shows and flag anything that looks off-story. Do not add markers until I approve a previewOnly marker plan.
```

For generation from the timeline:

```text
Use the selected clip or playhead frame as an image-to-video source. Preview the prepare_generation_from_timeline_context plan for LTX 2.3 first, then wait for my approval before opening Generate or queueing anything.
```

## Connection Details

Protocol:

- MCP over local HTTP.
- JSON-RPC endpoint: `POST http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp`
- Server-sent-event probe: `GET http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp`
- Server name: `velorn`
- Default protocol version: `2024-11-05`

The server starts with the desktop app. If the port is not available, check `Settings > Agents (MCP)` for the current status/error.

Tools that can work without an open project include:

- `get_project`
- `list_recent_projects`
- `open_project`
- `create_project`
- ComfyUI connection/setup tools
- workflow inspection tools
- `list_glsl_effects`

Most timeline, asset, generation, caption, and export tools need an open project and an up-to-date project snapshot.

## Direct JSON-RPC Smoke Test

Most users should use an MCP client, but developers can test the server directly:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"tools/list\",\"params\":{}}"
```

Call a read-only tool:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\"params\":{\"name\":\"get_project\",\"arguments\":{}}}"
```

## Recommended Workflows

### Timeline Health

Use this before export or before an agent starts editing:

1. `get_project`
2. `get_timeline`
3. `check_media_health`
4. `analyze_timeline`
5. `check_export_readiness`
6. Optional: `add_timeline_markers` with `previewOnly: true`, then apply after approval.

### Visual Shot Review

Use this for music videos, fast social cuts, and visual continuity review:

1. `set_playhead` if the user gives a start time.
2. `inspect_visible_shots` for a page of top-visible shots.
3. `inspect_timeline_range` for a sampled contact sheet across a range.
4. `inspect_clip` or `inspect_timeline_frame` for specific problems.
5. Optional: `add_timeline_markers` after preview/approval.

### Safe Timeline Cleanup

Use this when the user asks for concrete timeline changes:

1. `find_timeline_items`
2. `inspect_clip` for any ambiguous target.
3. Preview one of `move_clips`, `trim_clips`, `delete_clips`, `split_clip`, `extract_range`, `set_clip_speed`, or `set_clip_audio`.
4. Apply only after approval.
5. Use `undo` if the result is not right.

### Generate From Timeline Context

Use this to extend, replace, or vary a shot:

1. `inspect_timeline_frame`
2. `list_velorn_workflows`
3. `prepare_generation_from_timeline_context` with `previewOnly: true`
4. Apply the prepare step only after approval.
5. `queue_prepared_generation` or `queue_timeline_generation_batch` with preview first.
6. `get_generation_status`
7. `add_asset_to_timeline`, `add_assets_to_timeline`, or `replace_clip_with_asset` with preview first.

### Community Workflow Import

Use this when the user brings a workflow from outside the official catalog — a comfy.org share URL, a downloaded .json, or pasted workflow JSON (UI/graph export format only):

1. `import_comfyui_workflow` with `previewOnly: true` and one of `url`, `filePath`, or `workflowJson`.
2. Show the user the dependency report: unknown node types, registry-resolvable node packs, model references, and `modelsMissingUrl` (community workflows almost never embed download URLs — supply `modelUrls` hints with `{ filename, url, targetSubdir }` for those).
3. Apply the import after approval. The result includes the `tpl-` workflow id, whether it is runnable, and any required extra media inputs (`assetSelect` fields).
4. `install_workflow_setup` with `previewOnly: true` — show the node packs, model files, and total download size, then apply only after explicit approval. Use `only: { nodePackIds, modelFilenames }` to install a subset.
5. Poll `get_workflow_install_status`. If it recommends a restart, restart ComfyUI with `control_comfyui_launcher`, wait for the connection, and re-preview to confirm.
6. `queue_timeline_template_generation` with `importedWorkflowId` (preview first). Map extra inputs — for example a reference face image — through `assetFieldIds` using the field ids from the preview.
7. `get_generation_status`, then place results with `add_asset_to_timeline` or `replace_clip_with_asset` after preview.

Downloads are https-only, existing files are never overwritten, and nothing installs without an applied `install_workflow_setup` call.

### Prompt To Generated Assets

Use this when the user gives a creative brief instead of a timeline source:

1. `list_velorn_workflows`
2. `create_asset_folder` with preview first.
3. `queue_prompt_generation_batch` with preview first.
4. `get_generation_status`
5. `create_timeline` if a separate sequence is useful.
6. `add_assets_to_timeline`
7. Add titles, shapes, adjustment clips, and keyframes as needed.

### Captions

Use this for timeline-wide captions or per-asset transcription:

1. `transcribe_captions` with `previewOnly: true`
2. Apply after approval.
3. Poll `get_caption_status`
4. Fix cue text or timing with `update_caption_cues`
5. `generate_captions` with preview first.
6. Apply after approval to render the caption overlay and place it on the Captions track.

### Export

Use this when delivery matters:

1. `check_media_health`
2. `check_export_readiness`
3. Optional: `set_in_out_range`
4. `export_timeline` with `previewOnly: true`
5. Apply after approval.
6. `inspect_export_file`

For social variants, preview `export_delivery_batch` before running it.

For interchange, preview `export_fcpxml` before writing a file. Use `format: "fcpxml"` for Resolve/Final Cut or `format: "premiere"` for Adobe Premiere Pro.

### Media Placement And Replacement

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search_stock_media` | Search Pexels photos/videos and open the same results in Velorn's Stock tab. |
| `import_stock_media` | Preview/bulk-import selected Pexels IDs or the first N non-duplicate results into a project folder. |
| `import_asset_from_path` | Preview/import a local media file into the active project. |
| `relink_asset` | Preview/relink an existing asset record to a local file path. |

| `add_assets_to_timeline` | Preview/place multiple assets as review lanes or a sequence. |
| `replace_clip_with_asset` | Preview/replace a clip with another asset while preserving the edit slot and styling by default. |

Pexels search/import requires the user's API key in `Settings > Stock (Pexels)`. A safe agent flow is:

```text
Search Pexels photos for "ocean drone shots" with search_stock_media. Show me the result IDs first. Then preview importing 10 non-duplicate results with import_stock_media into Stock/Pexels/Ocean Drone Shots. Wait for approval before applying, and do not place anything on the timeline until I approve a separate add_assets_to_timeline preview.
```

`import_stock_media` re-runs the search before applying so result IDs are validated against Pexels instead of accepting arbitrary download URLs. Imported files become project-owned media and keep Pexels source/creator provenance in their asset metadata.

    "markers": [
      {
        "timeSeconds": 12.5,
        "label": "Check continuity",
        "color": "#ffa500"
      }
    ],
    "previewOnly": true
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### The MCP client cannot connect

- Make sure the Velorn desktop app is running.
- Check `Settings > Agents (MCP)` for `Running`.
- Confirm the endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:19790/mcp`.
- If the port is unavailable, another local process may already be using `19790`.
- Restart Velorn after changing development branches or rebuilding Electron code.

### The agent says no project is open

Open a project in Velorn, then try again. The agent can call `list_recent_projects` and `open_project`, but most timeline and asset tools need an active project snapshot.

### A write tool previews but does not apply

That is expected. Ask the agent to repeat the same tool call with `previewOnly: false` after you approve the preview.

### The agent cannot find the right clip

Ask it to use `find_timeline_items`, `inspect_visible_shots`, or `inspect_clip` before making changes. Prefer exact clip IDs for write actions.

### ComfyUI generation fails

Ask the agent to use:

1. `diagnose_comfyui_connection`
2. `get_comfyui_launcher_logs`
3. `validate_comfyui_nodes`
4. `inspect_velorn_workflow`

These tools can distinguish port issues, missing custom nodes, missing models, launcher problems, and workflow compatibility issues.

### Exports fail or look wrong

Ask the agent to run:

1. `check_media_health`
2. `check_export_readiness`
3. `export_timeline` with `previewOnly: true`
4. `inspect_export_file` after export

For square or vertical exports, make sure the agent previews `deliveryFraming` so you know whether the output will fit or crop the timeline frame.

## Notes For MCP Client Authors

- Use `tools/list` to discover schemas at runtime. The catalog can grow over time.
- Tool results are returned as MCP content blocks, usually text containing JSON.
- Frame and contact-sheet inspection tools may include image content when requested and when size limits allow.
- Keep the MCP client connected to the local machine running Velorn. This is not a cloud API.
- Do not assume a write tool changed the project unless the returned result says it applied successfully.
- Favor explicit IDs from read tools over natural-language targeting for write tools.
- Queueing generation and running exports can take time. Poll status tools such as `get_generation_status`, `get_caption_status`, or inspect output files after completion.
